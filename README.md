# 🛠 Michael Zhang – Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio. I’m a Computer Engineering student at the University of British Columbia, passionate about solving real-world problems through a blend of **software engineering**, **hardware integration**, and **intelligent systems design**.

This repository showcases a curated set of my technical projects. Each project demonstrates a unique combination of skills in system architecture, embedded development, robotics, data engineering, and full-stack implementation. All projects are based on **real, hands-on experience**—with documented code, visuals, and outcomes.

➕ 4-bit Adder/Subtractor in Verilog – APSC 262 Digital Logic Lab

Designed and implemented a 4-bit signed binary calculator in Verilog, capable of performing addition and subtraction using modular design principles (half adders, full adders, and ripple-carry logic).
	•	🧮 Components:
	•	Half Adder (HA), Full Adder (FA), Ripple-Carry Adder (RCA)
	•	Adder/Subtractor with XOR-based 2’s complement logic
	•	🧰 Tools: Quartus II, Altera DE1 Board (simulated), Verilog HDL
	•	✅ Functionality:
	•	Performs addition/subtraction of signed 4-bit binary numbers
	•	Detects overflow conditions
	•	Modular Verilog design reused across components
	•	💡 Learning Outcome: Gained hands-on experience with hardware-level arithmetic logic design, modular coding, and circuit verification.

⏱️ BCD Counter System in Verilog – APSC 270 Digital Logic Lab

Designed and implemented a Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) counter with both approximate and improved-timing versions. The system displays live second, tenth-second, and hundredth-second counts using a 50 MHz clock input.
	•	⚙️ Features:
	•	Real-time counter with 3-digit and 4-digit BCD display
	•	Pushbutton reset functionality
	•	Modularized 7-segment decoder
	•	🧰 Tools: Verilog HDL, Quartus II, Altera DE1 Board (simulated)
	•	🧩 Two Counter Variants:
	•	Part I: Simple 3-digit BCD counter with rough timing (0.67s intervals)
	•	Part II: Precision 4-digit BCD counter with near-accurate 0.01s intervals
	•	💡 Concepts:
	•	Always blocks, non-blocking assignments, clock edge sensitivity
	•	Bit-length calculation for time-accurate counting
	•	7-segment display encoding logic
