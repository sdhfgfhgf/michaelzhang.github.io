# 🛠 Michael Zhang – Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio. I’m a Computer Engineering student at the University of British Columbia, passionate about solving real-world problems through a blend of **software engineering**, **hardware integration**, and **intelligent systems design**.

This repository showcases a curated set of my technical projects. Each project demonstrates a unique combination of skills in system architecture, embedded development, robotics, data engineering, and full-stack implementation. All projects are based on **real, hands-on experience**—with documented code, visuals, and outcomes.

⏱️ BCD Counter System in Verilog – APSC 262 Digital Logic Lab Project

Designed and implemented a Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) counter with both approximate and improved-timing versions. The system displays live second, tenth-second, and hundredth-second counts using a 50 MHz clock input.
- ⚙️ Features:
- Real-time counter with 3-digit and 4-digit BCD display
- Pushbutton reset functionality
- Modularized 7-segment decoder
- 🧰 Tools: Verilog HDL, Quartus II, Altera DE1 Board (simulated)
- 🧩 Two Counter Variants:
- Part I: Simple 3-digit BCD counter with rough timing (0.67s intervals)
- Part II: Precision 4-digit BCD counter with near-accurate 0.01s intervals
- 💡 Concepts:
- Always blocks, non-blocking assignments, clock edge sensitivity
- Bit-length calculation for time-accurate counting
- 7-segment display encoding logic
